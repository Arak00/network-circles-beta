# Tester form

Thanks for trying this. It takes about 15 minutes.

## Your data stays on your machine

You run the tool on your own computer with your own LinkedIn export. Nothing is uploaded. The only thing you send back is the three scores below and, if you want, a comment. Please don't include names of people or companies in the comment.

## Run it

1. Request your data from LinkedIn (Settings, Data privacy, Get a copy of your data). Pick the larger archive, which includes Connections and Positions. LinkedIn emails a zip.
2. Open https://arak00.github.io/network-circles-beta/web/?own=1 and drop the zip on the page as it is. It's read in your browser tab and never uploaded.

   Or from a terminal: `python src/netmap.py <your_export_folder> results/private/graph.json`, then load that file in the viewer.
3. Look at Ways in, the first screen: the companies where you know someone, with who to ask at each. Point at a few rows to see those people on the map.
4. Open Circles and look through the groups for a few minutes. Each one says what holds it together: "Same company", "Added around the same time" (people you connected with within a few days of each other), or "Company and timing".

## Questions

Score each from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely). If you have no group of a kind, put `-`.

| # | Question | Score (1-5) |
|---|----------|-------------|
| q1a | Do the "Same company" groups match how you think of your network? | |
| q1b | Do the "Added around the same time" groups match how you think of your network? | |
| q2 | Are the group labels recognisable? | |
| q3 | Did anything feel wrong or missing? (1 = a lot felt wrong or missing, 5 = nothing did) | |
| q4 | On Ways in, for the companies you care about, is the person it says to ask the one you'd actually ask? | |
